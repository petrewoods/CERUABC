# CERUABC
CERU ABC prototype


This is an attempt to make an ABC tool. 

It aims to acheive a few things.
1. Ease of use, to encourage record keeping.
2. Overview of data, to spot patterns earlier.


The system must also be secure with data. As such this is only a prototype and will not contain any patient information until security is ensured. 

The overall programme has a few components


Input

A QR code will be by a patient's bedspace
This will be scannable linking to an easy to fill in ABC form. 

Database
ABCs will be stored securely on a database for that patient.

Output
A dashboard of the the ABC information, such as time of day, type of behaviour etc. will be viewable to enable clinicians to view information and spot patterns early. 
The dashboard should only be viewable to those with correct permissions.
